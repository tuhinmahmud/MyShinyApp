#Summary
The purpose of this project and presentation is to demonstrate how a shinyApp works and how it can be published online. The shiny app implemented here is a very simple one for getting the histogram of built in dataset cars.

The shiny App is available online:

https://tuhinmahmud.shinyapps.io/MyShinyCar/

##Input 
There are two inputs to this App:

1. The number of sample points from Car dataset (1st to the number chosen)
1. The column in the car dataset( e.g speed or dist)

##Output
1. A histogram depicting the frequency distribuiton of data points selected. 
1. A blue line that depicts *mean* value of the data points chosen.


## Embedded Shiny Application

```{r, echo=FALSE}
shinyApp(
    
ui=fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Analysis of dataset cars"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("obs", "Number of data points:", 10),
      selectInput("col_name", "Choose a column:", choices = c("speed", "dist"))
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
),

server=function(input, output) { 
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    row_count <- input$obs
    #data_col<-"speed"
    data_col<-input$col_name
    if( row_count < 0 )
        row_count <- nrow(cars)
    x    <- cars[1:row_count, c(data_col)]  
    mx <- mean(x)
    hist(x, main=paste("Histogram of",data_col),xlab=data_col)
    abline(v = mx, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
    text(mx,0, "mean", col = "red", adj = c(0, -.1))
  })
 }
)
```

###Reference:
This App was designed similar to tutorials that comes with Shiny package installations using Rmd and R
